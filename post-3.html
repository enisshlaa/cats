<p>That there are people who act from their hearts is a positive thing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A young lad, in our case, was just such a person.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tiny, a 10-year-old cat, was abandoned with his sibling in a shelter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because the cats were not particularly bonded to each other, they might be taken in by different homes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The shelter's website has a note next to a picture of this cat indicating as much.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, no one seemed in a rush to show Tiny affection. So our hero was heartbroken as a result.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Meanwhile, on the opposite side of town, a youngster named Easton was looking at the shelter's website.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because his mother permitted him to keep one pet, the truth of the matter is. If it's a kitten, it may be a puppy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Easton saw Tiny for the first time. Love at first sight was the case.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":3938,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img src="https://viralonce.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/young-boy-adopted-elderly-cat-2.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-3938"/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Easton and his mother rushed to the shelter as soon as they woke up in the morning to meet Tiny.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The encounter was delightful, thanks in large part to the cat's obvious devotion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the end, it turned out to be Easton who was his friend and companion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tiny stayed close to his new owner and purred louder than the car's engine the entire ride home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They've become inseparable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They are always in one other's company, even while they are sleeping.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That they were able to discover each other is a wonderful thing for both of them.</p>
