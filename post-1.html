<p>Four cats were saved from a sinking ship by Thai Navy sailors in the Andaman Sea.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Early in March of 2021, everything came to a head. The ship has received a distress call.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ship's crew was able to escape before the main body of the vessel was buried in water in a couple of minutes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sailing sailors from Thailand's royal navy decided to re-check the overturned vessel for any probable oil spill after rescuing the crew.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Colosseum was nearly fully underwater at this point.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When the soldiers looked at the situation from a safe distance, they were surprised to see four cats.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tattaphon Sai, a 23-year-old man, sprang into the water and swam to the sinking ship to save the animals.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On his shoulders, a small boy carried all the animals to a navy ship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite the evident risk, the hero declared that he had no intention of abandoning the animals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Despite their best efforts, they were unable to reach the ground on their own.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the beach, the animals were taken.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The rescued kitties are still being cared for by the military. Their health and well-being are no longer in jeopardy.</p>
