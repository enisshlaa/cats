        <h1 class="title-us">When a stranger’s cat was diagnosed with an incurable condition, Reddit users rallied behind her to donate the money she needed to preserve her pet.</h1>
       <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The year began with the death of a close family member for Jill. After a long struggle with brain cancer, her brother passed away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It doesn't end well, either, because the girl is desperately trying to save Ashton, her cat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Coronaviruses carrying RNA are the primary cause of F.I.P., a serious infectious illness that is sometimes deadly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Infecting the body's immune cells, the virus then spreads to organs and systems such as the liver, kidneys, spleen, eyes, brain, and spinal cord as a whole.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The medicine has been used to treat this illness in recent years in the United States and in a few European nations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although the FDA has not yet approved it, it has already saved numerous lives in the interim.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was revealed to Jill by the veterinarian that her cat may still be rescued, but the expense of therapy was too exorbitant for her.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So she resorted to Reddit users, pleading with them to assist in extending Ashton's time on this earth for as long as possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"I'm at the end of my tether." My life revolves around him," said Jill.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Animal lovers from all around the world took notice of her message right away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many of them expressed an interest in sending money to Jill to help pay for the cat's treatment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jill was approached by an experienced Reddit member.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He spoke to the young lady on the phone and got all about Ashton's medical history from her.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The man shared a link to a fundraiser he suggested Jill set up on a crowdsourcing site with the rest of the group.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The total amount collected in only a few short hours surpassed the announced goal of $9,000!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jill expressed her gratitude to everyone who contributed and promised to keep everyone updated on Ashton's treatment progress and expenses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"It's going to be a long road, but now I have hope because of you." She stated on the collection page, "I am really thankful to each of you."</p>
